# Vue CSS Flex/Grid Demo

Simple app that demos CSS flexbox and CSS Grids. It's also a Vuejs app so it's a nice demo for a simple setup with routing.

The examples here are basically following (with some modifications) the examples posted by [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/), specifically following his [flexbox tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc) and [grid tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o).
